    "documents": "Hello. Thank you for calling Contoso. Who am I speaking with today? Hi, Mary. Are you calling because you need health insurance? Great. If you can answer a few questions, we can get you signed up in the jiffy. So what's your full name? Got it. And what's the best call back number in case we get disconnected? Yeah, that'll be fine. Got it. So to confirm, it's 234-554-9312. Excellent. Let's get some additional information from your applicant for your application. Do you have a job? OK, so then you have a Social Security number as well. OK And what is your Social Security number, please? Sorry, what was that, A-25 or A225? You cut out for a bit. All right. Thank you so much. And could I have your e-mail address, please? Great. That is the last question. So let me take your information and I'll be able to get you signed up right away. Thank you for calling Contoso and I'll be able to get you signed up immediately. One of our agents will call you back in about 24 hours or so to confirm your application. Absolutely. If you need anything else, please give us a call at 1-800-555-5564 ext 123. Thank you very much for calling Contoso. Yes, of course. So the default is a digital membership card, but we can send you a physical card if you prefer. Yeah, absolutely. I've made a note on your file. You're very welcome. Thank you for calling Contoso and have a great day."
